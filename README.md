# project2-battleport
Creating a digital version of Battleport

#edit Rens 18-01-2016
Added my file as the Master game-file.
Current features:
  - Main menu screen.
  - Changeable game-loops. In other words 'level system'.
  
Class overview:
  - Game (class).
      Used for running the game.
      Has the game-loop and all other necissary things to run a game.
  - Animations (class).
      Used for generating a sequence of pictures in a loop.
  - Button (class).
      Used for creating clickable buttons that can execute a function.
  - Menu (class).
      Used for creating the menu buttons.
      (almost) Flexible enough to create different menus.
